          <p>To pin REAPER to the dock, simply drag and drop the 
      REAPER icon from the Applications folder on to the Dock. We 
      strongly recommend that you should also, under System 
      Preferences, ensure that for your Mouse right click is enabled as a secondary button.</p>
          <p>If you are installing REAPER for the first time, or if you wish to replace an earlier version of REAPER with 
      this one, you should accept the default destination folder and not enable portable install. If you wish to install 
      this alongside an existing earlier version (such as 5.xx), change the default directory (e.g. to \REAPER6) and 
      enable portable install. This will ensure that your earlier 5.xx settings and preferences will be preserved 
      separately</p>

          <p>To open an existing REAPER Project File, use the File, Open Project command, or the keyboard shortcut 
      Ctrl O. As with other Windows Apps, you will need to navigate to the appropriate folder to find your project. 
      Recently used projects can more easily be opened using the File, Recent Projects command. This causes a list 
      of up to the last 100 recently used project files to be displayed. You can then select any file from that list.</p>
          <p>Notice too the toggle command Continuous scrolling on the Options menu. If disabled (the default), the play 
      cursor will scroll from left to right during playback. If enabled, this cursor will find and then remain stationary in 
      the center of the arrange window during playback, while the media items scroll across the screen. </p>

          <p>Use project file as a template. This enables you to use an existing project file as a template for new 
      projects. All tracks, HX, tracks, buses, routing etc. will be copied into the new file from the template file.</p>
          <p>Automatically save to a timestamped file at intervals you specify. This can help to protect you 
      from the consequences of an unforeseen circumstance such as a power outage or a computer crash. You 
      can save these files to the project directory and/or an additional directory. You can also specify the 
      frequency (in minutes) of automatic saving, and whether to apply this when not recording, when 
      stopped, or at any time.</p>

          <header>Managing tracks</header>
          <p>REAPER automatically groups your FX in 
      various ways â€“ by type (VSTi, VST, JS, etc.), 
      by category (Analyzer, Dynamics, EQ, etc.) 
      and by developers (e.g. Melda, Voxengo, 
      Wave Arts). In addition, you can create your 
      own group folders.
      FX can be grouped as you wish. For example, 
      you might wish to create a folder called 
      Chorus/Delay/Reverb to display these plug-
      ins together. You can create as many folders 
      as you wish, and the same plug-in can be 
      placed in more than one folder.</p>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Add a new folder</li>
            <li>Add a new smart folder </li>
            <li>Add FX to a folder</li>
            <li>Display folder contents</li>
            <li>Add FX to track or item</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="USING_LOOPS">
          <header>Using loops</header>
          <p>Any audio, MIDI or click source Item can be 
      looped. Indeed, by default REAPER media 
      items are loop enabled. You can disable this 
      for individual items in the Media Item 
      Properties dialog box, or globally (for MIDI 
      and imported items) on the Project, Media 
      Item Defaults page of your Preferences.</p>
          <p>The loop point is defined by the duration of the source media. If you insert an item that is four bars long, it will 
      loop every 4 bars, if it is 8 bars, it will loop every 8 bars, etc. Note that in the following examples, if you are 
      using beats for your timebase, the item must be an exact number of beats in length, or it will not loop in sync. If 
      necessary, adjust the playback rate (Media Properties) while preserving pitch, then glue the item to do this.</p>
