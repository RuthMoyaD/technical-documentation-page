# Reaper User Guide ‚Äì Technical Documentation Practice

This is a basic **technical documentation page** built using only HTML and CSS, as part of a beginner web development exercise.

The goal was to recreate the layout of a documentation page, similar to what you'd see in a developer guide or user manual. For this example, I chose to base it on the **REAPER DAW** (Digital Audio Workstation), one of my favorite audio tools.

## Features

- Fixed vertical navigation bar
- Section links using anchor tags
- Semantic HTML structure (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`)
- Organized content with headings, paragraphs, and simple lists

## What I practiced

- Building multi-section layouts
- Using IDs and internal links
- Improving content structure for readability
- Creating a responsive layout (basic)

üõ†Ô∏è This was part of my early practice in HTML/CSS ‚Äì simple, functional, and a small step in learning how to structure technical content on the web.
